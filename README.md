# dafxJUCE

This repo seeks to act as an introduction to digital audio effects by implementing some of the different basic examples provided in [DAFX: Digital Audio Effects](http://www.dafx.de).

The implementation is done through the vst plug-in framework JUCE for realworld applications and an easy direct way of testing how the different effects affects the sound.

##### Getting started

The build system is based on Cmake, drawn directly from the cmake files auto-generated by ProJucer.
At the moment, only MacOS is supported/implemented.

##### Project structure

All individual FXs is placed in each Git submodule. The FXs shouldn't be dependent on eachother and thus, they can be version controlled apart from eachother.

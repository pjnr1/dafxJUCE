# dafxJUCE

This repo seeks to act as an introduction to digital audio effects by implementing some of the different basic examples provided in [DAFX: Digital Audio Effects, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/DAFX-Digital-Effects-Udo-ZÃ¶lzer/dp/0470665998).

The implementation is done through the vst plug-in framework JUCE for realworld applications and an easy direct way of testing how the different effects affects the sound.

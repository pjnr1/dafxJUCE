# dafxJUCE

This repo seeks to act as an introduction to digital audio effects by implementing some of the different basic examples provided in _DAFX: Digital Audio Effects (edited by Udo ZÃ¶lzer)_.

The implementation is done through the vst plug-in framework JUCE for realworld applications and an easy direct way of testing how the different effects affects the sound.
